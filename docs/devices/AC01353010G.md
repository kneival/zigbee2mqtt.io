# OSRAM AC01353010G

| Model | AC01353010G  |
| Vendor  | OSRAM  |
| Description | SMART+ Motion Sensor |
| Supports | occupancy and temperature |
| Picture | ![OSRAM AC01353010G](../images/devices/AC01353010G.jpg) |

## Notes

### Pairing 
Press and hold the grey button on the side for longer than 10 seconds to reset the device. The blue light will flash behind the PIR lens to indicate "scanning for network".

### LED Behaviour
Continuous Blinking Blue - Scanning for network
Solid Green (2 Seconds) - Network Joined
Solid Blue (2 Seconds) - Power On

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*


* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.occupancy }}"
    device_class: "motion"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
    device_class: "temperature"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature }}"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery_low}}"
    device_class: "battery"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "-"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
